                <p> Quiet Bloom is a period-tracking app that helps users understand how mood and energy change across
                    the menstrual cycle. Using previous months of data, it predicts upcoming periods and ovulation as
                    well as expected mood, energy, and pain levels. Users can also write daily journal entries. </p>

                        <h3>Tschnu</h3>
                        <p>I was mainly responsible for the calendar page, including making sure it loads correctly,
                            displaying past months, and showing predictions for ovulation and periods. I also integrated
                            the multiselect tool. Displaying the period properly turned out to be quite challenging,
                            because different flow types had to be shown on the correct days. In addition, I designed
                            most of the icons, and I am very happy with how they turned out. At first, I was unsure
                            whether we would be able to build a fully working app, but I’m glad that it worked out and
                            that we now have a functional app.</p>

                        <h3>Leti</h3>
                        <p>My main responsibility was creating the statistics page and setting up the calculations.
                            Because we decided not to use a library for the graphs, this became quite a challenge and
                            took multiple days to implement correctly. Setting up the calculations was easier than
                            creating the graphs, but still difficult, especially when deciding how many months of data
                            to use so the app would not become too slow while still producing accurate results. In the
                            end, I really like the app because it feels genuinely useful, and I am very happy with how
                            it turned out. Even though we changed quite a bit of the initial design, I’m glad we found a
                            solution that fits both the app and our vision.

                        <p>This user study was conducted to evaluate how well the features of the Quiet Bloom app are
                            integrated
                            and how useful they are for users. The study focused on the app’s usability, intuitiveness,
                            and
                            overall user experience. Participants tested the app and provided feedback on how easily
                            they could
                            understand and use its features, as well as how clearly predictions and visual elements were
                            presented. The results helped identify strengths of the app and uncover areas where
                            improvemnt was
                            needed.</p>

                        <h3>1. Introcuction</h3>
                        <p>Quiet Bloom is a period tracker which allows users to not only log their period but also
                            their
                            painlevel, energylevel, mood and journal entry for everyday. But there is also the option to
                            log the
                            entire period with a multiselect tool for people who dont wanna input everyday. There is a
                            quick
                            overview on form of a calendar page where the user can see their last 6 months of periods
                            and
                            predictions of periods for the next 6 months as well as ovulation. Ther also is a additional
                            page
                            for analysis where the user can overview their bloodflow, mood, energy level and pain level
                            of the
                            current month but also see a prediction for all those catgories for the current and the next
                            two
                            months as well as a mood overview for the current month.
                            Our app is for people who menstruate and want a deeper understanding of how their mood and
                            energy levels fluctuate over the course of their cycle and also want precise predictions for
                            ther
                            bloodflow and pain levels. <br>
                            Based on this we formulated following hypotheses: <br>
                            <strong>H0:</strong> The app does not help users predict and understand their mood, pain,
                            energy levels, and period
                            flow in a simple and easy-to-understand way?<br>
                            <strong>H1:</strong> Does the app help users predict and understand their mood, pain, energy
                            levels, and period flow
                            in a simple and easy-to-understand way?

                        <h3>3. User Study</h3>

                        <p>
                            This user study follows a relational, within-subject design and was conducted to evaluate
                            the
                            usability of the Quiet Bloom app. The independent variable of the study was the type of app
                            used,
                            while the dependent variable was the perceived usability of the app, including
                            intuitiveness, ease
                            of use, and clarity of predictions and visual elements.

                            The study included nine participants, with a total of ten test sessions conducted over two
                            rounds.
                            All participants were between 20 and 25 years old, menstruating, and mostly familiar with
                            period-tracking applications. Quantitative data was collected using the System Usability
                            Scale (SUS)
                            and the Single Ease Question (SEQ). In addition, qualitative data was gathered through
                            think-aloud
                            comments during task execution and semi-structured interviews, focusing on user feedback
                            regarding
                            predictions, statistics, visual design, and the perceived accuracy and usefulness of the

                            The usability tests were conducted as moderated sessions using a think-aloud protocol.
                            Participants
                            were asked to complete specific tasks while verbalizing their thoughts and impressions.
                            After
                            completing each task, participants filled out the SEQ, and after all tasks were completed,
                            they
                            filled out the SUS.

                        <h4>3.1 Test Round 1</h4>

                        <p>
                            The first test round focused on gathering initial feedback on the overall usability and
                            design of
                            the app. Participants were given a set of tasks to complete and were then given the
                            opportunity to
                            further explore the app during a short interview. The emphasis was on understanding how
                            intuitive
                            the app felt, how clearly features were presented, and how users percieved the visual design
                            and
                            general structure of the application.

                        <p>
                            The second test round concentrated on evaluating newly implemented features and design
                            changes based
                            on insights from the first round. Participants tested updates such as the multiselect tool,
                            changes
                            in element placement, and the addition of ovulation tracking. This round aimed to assess
                            whether
                            these improvements enhanced usability, clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to
                            the
                            initial version.

                                During the first test round, we evaluated the main features and design choices.

                            <p>
                                Task 0 was designed to evaluate how accurately Quiet Bloom calculates the next period.
                                Users were asked to input their last three periods into the calendar and then compare
                                our
                                prediction with their current period app.
                                The means for each input scenario were: when only one month was entered, the prediction
                                was on
                                average 1 day off; with two months, it was 1.25 days off; and with three months, it was
                                1 day
                                off.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Task 1 focused on adding an entry for the current day, including blood flow, pain, mood,
                                energy,
                                and a journal entry.
                                The average SEQ score for this task was 6.8. Users mentioned that the current day was
                                not
                                clearly marked in the calendar, which made it harder to find.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Task 2 tested whether users could find statistics about their average cycle and period
                                length.
                                This task received an average score of 5.8, with the main concern being that the
                                elements looked
                                like input fields due to the styling.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Task 3 was designed to test whether users could find their journal entries overview.
                                This task also received a score of 5.8. Users commented that the element looked like a
                                header
                                and therefore it was unclear that it was a clickable button.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Task 4 investigated whether the delete button on the add-entry page was too hidden.
                                This turned out to be the case, with a difficulty rating of 5.8.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Task 5 evaluated how users felt about the graphs.
                                They were rated with an average score of 5.8. Main comments were that the colors were
                                too dull
                                to differentiate, the graphs were a bit overwhelming to understand, and some axes were
                                missing
                                labels.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The last task tested whether users would find the settings.
                                This task was rated with an average SEQ score of 6.2. The only complaints were that
                                changes were
                                saved automatically and that the options menu opened on the wrong side of the screen.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Interview feedback further suggested that displaying ovulation more clearly and adding a
                                multi-select input tool for symptoms and states would be beneficial.
                            </p>

                            <p>After the first completed test round, multiple features were changed. A multiselect tool
                                was implemented, which makes it faster to track periods if users do not want to input
                                every day separately. On the calendar page, we marked the current date and added a
                                shortcut to quickly jump back to today. On the add-entry page, the delete button was
                                changed to be more visible. The colors of the graphs were adjusted, and only the first
                                two categories are shown when entering the page to make it less overwhelming. The graphs
                                also received short descriptions. Additionally, multiple small design choices were
                                refined to make the interface more intuitive.</p>

                                Task 1 tested the multi-input tool. This task received an average SEQ score of 5.2.
                                Users mentioned
                                that the icon was not clear and that system visibility was not sufficiently

                                Task 2 was designed to assess whether the shortcut back to the current date was clear.
                                This was
                                rated very positively, with an average score of 7.

                                Task 3 checked whether it was clear what represents the actual period, what is a
                                prediction, and
                                what indicates ovulation.
                                While most users found this understandable, one comment pointed out that users without
                                prior
                                experience with period apps might struggle.
                                Therefore, adding a legend was suggested. This task received an average SEQ score of
                                6.8.

                                Task 4 evaluated whether the UI changes made it clearer where to find the journal
                                entries.
                                This task was rated with an average SEQ score of 6.8, showing an improvement compared to
                                the first

                                screen clearer.

                                After the second round, we made a few more adjustments. Both the calendar page and the
                                add-entry page received info points to help less experienced users better understand
                                their cycle. The color of the blood splatters on the calendar page was also improved to
                                increase the visibility of dates.

                        <p>Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Quiet Bloom was designed to help users better understand their menstrual cycle and how mood,
                            energy, pain, and blood flow change over time through simple tracking and clear
                            visualizations. The user study showed that participants generally found the app intuitive,
                            helpful, and easy to use, supporting our hypothesis that the app can assist users in
                            predicting and understanding their cycle in a simple and understandable way.</p>
                        <p> While statistical analysis of SUS scores did not show a significant difference between the
                            two test rounds, qualitative feedback and task-based results indicate that the implemented
